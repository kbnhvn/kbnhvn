I'm a former front-end developer moving towards a DevOps engineer role. Always passionate about technology, I'm curious and love learning on my own. My background includes both front-end and back-end skills, and now I'm excited to dive into DevOps, aiming to bridge the gap between development and operations to create efficient and scalable solutions.
