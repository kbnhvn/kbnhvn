I am a former web developer who has now graduated as a DevOps engineer. Always passionate about technology, I am curious and love learning on my own. My background includes both front-end and back-end skills, and now I am excited to dive into DevOps, aiming to bridge the gap between development and operations to create efficient and scalable solutions.
